This repository contains a bunch of scripts and config files
that I have gathered over the years. They are sometimes well
documented, but don't count on that.

Files gethered in this repository are for my own reference,
so that I would know why I've done things this and not the
other way, and if any of my work happens to be useful for
you then great.
